# Damian: DAMe's evil twin

This program is a updated and impoved version of [DAMe](https://github.com/shyamsg/dame) and its predecessor [DAMe](https://github.com/lisandracady/DAMe). Like DAMe, Damian is built to metabarcoding sequence data and make it ready for processing using downstream processing tools such as [obitools](https://metabarcoding.org/obitools), and the [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) pipeline.
